Step 0: A search and replace of " ; " with "; ", etc, can fix a lot of problems from the start. Same for " : ", " ! ", " ? ".

Step 1: Scan the new page for italics, em-dashes, Greek letters, and section breaks.

For italics, use *italics*. 

For an em-dash write "---".

Subsections in the text often begin with the character "§". Use [§]{.section} NB: This character won't run through pandoc to conver to word. Check this out later.

Step 2: Read the plain-text, look for OCR errors, and remove dashes in words split over lines and pages. 

Leave each line of text on a separate line in the book, with a blank line between paragraphs. 

If a word is split between lines with a dash, remove it and place that word on the line where it starts. Likewise, if a word is split on the pagebreak, put the full word on the page where it starts.

Where the page breaks, say at the beginning of page 5, write [5]{.pagenum}.
