## PREFACE 



I WILL beg leave to plead that these pages are 
lectures and not a treatise. The handling rests on a 
system, but it is less systematic than suggestive in 
form. Some repetition also may perhaps be tolerated 
on this ground. The same may, I hope, be borne in 
mind in regard to the style. Most of the discourses were 
in part delivered to an audience, which may account 
for features that would be less in place if only meant for 
the eye. The spoken style admits for instance of 
inflections and emphases which made sufficiently clear a 
sentence that may have to be read twice. It admits also 
of more ease and intimacy at times, of personal references 
and spiritual applications foreign to the remoter and more 
ambitious idea of a treatise. Moreover the position I 
take up makes the personal religion of the matter the 
base of the theology. 

I cannot hope to have made every suggestion on 
such a theme as obvious as it should be in a press 
article. It is a subject in which the writer must rely 
much on the co-operative effort of the reader, and 
must chiefly court the student. The merchantmen of 
these goodly pearls must be seekers ; and without 
even divers they cannot be had.

If it came to expressing obligations the foot of each 
page would bristle with notes and references. But 
that also is foreign to the lecture form, and especially 
to the form of lectures which made a certain effort to 
be as popular as the subject and its depth allowed. 
Besides, an apparatus of the kind would have given to 
the book an aspect of erudition which its author does 
not possess. It is not meant for scholars, but largely 
for ministers of the Word which it seeks in its own way 
to serve. It does not extend the frontiers of scientific 
knowledge or thought in its subject. One or two 
references I have given. But had they been multiplied 
there are some names that would have incessantly 
recurred. And especially those of Rothe, Kähler, Seeberg 
and Grutzmacher without whom these pages would have 
been lean indeed. In certain moods, as one traces back 
the origin of some lines of thought or even phrases of 
speech, the words come to mind, "What have I that I 
have not received?" 

Those who read to the end will find that the writer 
agrees with the opinion that the British attitude to 
criticism must be above all critical. The service 
rendered to Christianity by the great critical movement 
is almost beyond words. And there is a vast amount 
of foreign work which duly and practically recognises 
the fact, without surrendering the note of a positive 
Gospel. But it is a misfortune to us, which is also 
almost beyond reckoning, that most of the translated 
works are those of a more or less destructive school. 
For extremes are always easier to grasp and to sell. It 
should also be added in fairness that many scholars of 
the negative side possess the art of putting things; in 
high contrast with the style of their deeper opponents, so

amorphous often both in matter and mode. The mis 
fortune to the partially educated in this subject, who only 
read English, is great ; especially as the popular impression 
is produced (and sometimes pursued) that all the ability 
and knowledge are on one side. Certain nimble popular 
journals live on the delusion; and they have not so much 
as heard whether there be alongside of brilliants like 
Wernle or Schmiedel giants like Kähler or Zahn. It 
would not be too much to say that the latter two are 
among the most powerful minds of the world in the 
region one of theology, and one of scholarship. Yet in 
this country, and certainly to our preachers, they are 
almost unknown. 

It may be useful to add that the lectures were under 
taken ten years ago, that the lines of treatment were 
being then laid down in the writer s mind, and that in 
the choice of his subject he took counsel with none, met 
no request, and even had to put aside suggestions of 
subjects which it would have been valuable to follow. 
The Congregational Union, under whose auspices the 
lecture stands, simply asked the present writer to be the 
next to deliver it. The Union neither prescribed nor 
suggested subject or point of view. And responsibility 
belongs entirely to the author to whom was given so free 
a hand.
